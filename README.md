# Sliding-Window--Brute-Force (Day - 1 of #100daysCodingChallenge - DSA)
Hey, today i have solved Sliding Window Problem using Brute Force approach.

What i learned and how i solved?
Yes, here it is-

I got to know about sliding window problem on youtube by Aditya Verma. He explained about the problem and way of approach to solve it using brute force approach. Basically the problem is to find the sub-arrays of original array given to you and sub-array elements should be in continuous manner and calculate the sum of each sub-array to get the maximum sub-array sum which is our output for this problem. The term "Sliding Window" came from number of elements in sub-array which is changing dynamically and moves forward(sliding) like window kind of thing. 


1) I opened the code editor and started writing the code with my coding knowledge. Successfully i have written the code correctly, but there are some modifications need to done in checking condition in loops. 
2) I got the paper and write the conditions and test cases on my own, iterate the loop and developed a condition to terminate the loop by window-size to get the sub-array elements sum.
3) I made the changes to my code without any resources or googling, but assigned some work to the brain and write the code very clean and easier to understand.

Now, Ready to tackle this problem in different and optimal approaches soon!!
